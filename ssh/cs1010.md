# CS1010 Passwordless setup

## Passwordless login from local -> sunfire

In your local environment: execute the following command in bash

```bash
# Create a unique ssh public/private key for this server with a comment of your server name. When prompted for password just fill in blank, because the purpose is to NOT enter any pswd.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_sunfire -C "sunfire"

# Change permission of our key
# The reason we need to chmod 600 is that ssh do not like your private key to be seen by other people using the server.
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_sunfire

# Copy key to remote server
ssh-copy-id remote_username@server_ip_address
# Or do this if the above command fails
# cat ~/.ssh/id_sunfire.pub | ssh <your soc username>@sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Add the following lines to your local `~/.ssh/config` file
```bash
Host sunfire
    HostName sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg
    User <your SOC username>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_sunfire
```

Try `ssh sunfire` from your terminal, and it should have log you in into sunfire without prompting any password.

## Passwordless login from sunfire -> pe cluster

Next, in sunfire, execute the following lines in bash

```bash
# Create a unique ssh public/private key for this server with a comment of your server name. When prompted for password just fill in blank, because the purpose is to NOT enter any pswd.
# the following command will create a default public / private key pair stored in id_rsa
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# Change permission of our key
# The reason we need to chmod 600 is that ssh do not like your private key to be seen by other people using the server.
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Copy key to pe120.
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pe120 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Try executing `ssh pe120` from sunfire. It should log you into pe120 without prompting any password.

Now exit from sunfire by typing `exit`.

## Passwordless login from local -> pe cluster via sunfire

From your local machine, do `scp sunfire:~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_pe120`

Add the following lines to your local `~/.ssh/config` file
```bash
Host pe120
    HostName pe120.comp.nus.edu.sg
    User <your SOC username>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_pe120
    ForwardAgent yes
    ProxyJump sunfire
```

Now try `ssh pe120`, it should log you in directly to pe120 without prompting any password.

## Usage

- To log in to pe120 without typing any password, execute `ssh pe120`
- To log in to other pe cluster you can do `ssh -t sunfire ssh pe111`
- To copy file from local to pe120's home folder, execute `scp <local/path/to/file> pe120:~`
